    In this episode, We listen to Coldplums read and translate a lyrical song poem by Xin Qiji. Xin was a chinese military leader in exile and a master at 'Ci' form of poetry. We dig in to Coldplums's gift of scissoring out the most moving and beautiful pieces of verse from the universe of literature. The conversation takes us to the intense romance between two poets Paul Celan and Ingeborg Bachmann. A nostalgia for a time when people wrote letters is also shared. You can hopefully excuse us for that indulgence.
